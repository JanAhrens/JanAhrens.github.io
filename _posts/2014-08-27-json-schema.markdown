title: JSON Schema talk

Some time ago [Jens](https://twitter.com/DASKaJA) and I started the
[WebAPI Hamburg Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/webapi-hamburg/). At the
last meetup I did a lightning talk on JSON Schema.

It's a rather basic talk with the intention of motivating people to
look into JSON Schema for their APIs. You can have a look at the
slides below:

If you are on a small screen, you might want to open the
[slides](http://blog.jan-ahrens.eu/json-schema-talk) in a new tab.

I created the slides using [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark/),
which I can highly recommend. You can write your slides using Markdown
and that's really great.
