A dark full-screen terminal window. That is what you see mostly on my
screen. I've fallen in love with the terminal since I got to know
"cmd.exe" on my parents Windows computer. A few years later I was
lucky enough to discover that Windows and "cmd.exe" isn't the most
effective way to work and I started to learn about Linux and Bash.

Nowadays I'm still using terminal windows to get stuff done. Until
recently it really where windows. Many windows. My favorite shortcut
on my Linux machine was `Ctrl-Alt-t` - start a new terminal. At work
I'm using a Mac. My muscle memory contains key combinations to create
terminal windows and switch between them on both systems. It was
okay. It never really bothered me - until a colleague introduced me to
"tmux" - the <strong>t</strong>erminal<strong> mu</strong>ltiple<strong>x</strong>er.

The idea of tmux is really simple. Instead of having multiple windows
with one shell prompt, why not have a single terminal window with many
shell prompts. tmux saves me from opening a lot of terminal
windows. But wait, there's more!

You can split windows (horizontally and vertically), scroll and search
through the terminal output, copy-and-paste from inside tmux, manage
groups of windows and use it for
[remote pair programming](http://pivotallabs.com/how-we-use-tmux-for-remote-pair-programming/).
Interested? Then let's get started with the vocabulary.

Sessions, windows and panes. That are the building blocks of tmux.
When I started to learn about it I needed some time to get the
meaning. What helped me was to map the tmux concepts to those of my
beloved terminal programs iTerm and gnome-terminal.

You can think of tmux as the equivalent of your terminal program, like
iTerm or gnome-terminal. A tab in your terminal program is called
window in tmux. When you would start another window inside your
terminal program, you start a new session in tmux. Splitting one tab of
your terminal window tabs into different parts is what tmux calls splitting
a window into panes (you can't do that with gnome-terminal).

The first thing my colleague recommended me to change was the "prefix
key". It's the key combination that tmux intercepts to recognize its
commands. By default the prefix key is
[`Ctrl-b`](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1#x4b45592042494e44494e4753).
This is also used in Emacs to
[move one character backward](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Moving-Point.html)
so I ended up
[changing the prefix key](https://github.com/JanAhrens/dotfiles/blob/6cc0a7ad7e1292f2dfb77580cb4f72fb42fd8d52/.tmux.conf#L5-L7)
`Ctrl-]`.
It's easy to type with an English keyboard layout and not bound in any
of the programs I use. In most posts about tmux you'll see that people
reference the prefix key as `prefix` instead of assuming that it's
`Ctrl-b`. I'll do the same and write `prefix c` instead of `Ctrl-b c`
(default prefix key) or `Ctrl-] c` (my custom prefix key).

If you haven't done already it's now time to start tmux and follow
along. Reading about tmux is not as much fun as reading about tmux and
immediately trying it. Just open your regular terminal program,
install tmux and start a new session with `tmux new`.

Type `prefix c` to create a new window in tmux. At the bottom of the
tmux window you see the "status line". An asterisks next to the window
name shows the active window. It should currently be the second one,
because you created a new window. tmux starts to count its windows
from 0 on. If you want to switch back to the first window, you have to
type `prefix 0`. You can also used `prefix n` and `prefix p` to jump
to the next and previous window. That enough with windows for now,
let's focus on panes. Let's close the second window (`prefix 1`) by
ending the shell process (`exit` or `Ctrl-d`).

To split your current window in two horizontal panes type `prefix "`.
You can move to the next pane with `prefix o`. A very cool feature is
to directly jump to a pane by typing `prefix q` (you'll see numbers
appearing in the panes) and then press the number of the pane you want
to jump to (`prefix q 0` for example). That feature blew my mind when
I found out about it.
